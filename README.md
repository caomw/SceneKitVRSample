# SceneKit VR Sample

It's a 3D VR sample project using SceneKit. Panning with a finger tilts the camera, while with two fingers makes you move. It's my very first Swift project, the code might not be a perfect yet, but still legable.

- Refactored
- Fix to avoid rendering bugs Metal makes, by forcing it to use GL
- Now (theoritically) it is made for HMDs 
- Next goal is to apply physics engine

**[Feb. 22 2016]** 
- The very basic Prototype -- working with only one scene
- Shades are gone because of bugs I don't know where it comes from yet.

Thankfully I could stole the most of objects and tetures from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/SceneKitReel/Introduction/Intro.html">sample projects by Apple</a>, <a href="http://tf3dm.com/">tf3dm.com</a>, and <a href="http://sharecg.com">sharecg.com</a>
