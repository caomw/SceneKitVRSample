It's a 3D VR sample project using SceneKit. Panning with a finger tilts the camera, while with two fingers makes you move. 


**TODO List:**
- Physics engine to detect collision
- Accelerometer control
- Barrel shader enhancement

- Add shaders for VR rendering

**[Feb. 22 2016]** 
- The very basic Prototype -- working with only one scene

Thankfully I could stole the most of objects and tetures from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/SceneKitReel/Introduction/Intro.html">sample projects by Apple</a>, <a href="http://tf3dm.com/">tf3dm.com</a>, and <a href="http://sharecg.com">sharecg.com</a>
