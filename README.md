# SceneKitSample

It's a 3D sample project using SceneKit. Panning with a finger tilts the camera, while with two fingers makes you move.

SceneKit apparently still little bit buggy, casting shadow options of all spotlights are turned off becuase it crashes when it turned on and there are 4 or more lights. (I couldn't figure it out yet wheter it's my fault or Apple's) It's my very first Swift project, the code is a kind of crap, but maybe still legable.

Thankfully I could stole the most of objects and tetures from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/SceneKitReel/Introduction/Intro.html">sample projects by Apple</a>, <a href="http://tf3dm.com/">tf3dm.com</a>, and <a href="http://sharecg.com">sharecg.com</a>
