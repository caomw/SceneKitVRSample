# SceneKitSample

It's a 3D sample project using SceneKit. Panning with a finger tilts the camera, while with two fingers makes you move. It's my very first Swift project, the code might be a kind of crappy, but still legable.

Currently casting shadow options of all spotlights are turned off becuase it makes crashes when the number of lights is more than the specific number, or makes wrong shadows on my iPad mini 2. (I didn't have enough time to figure it out details, but I guess there are some bugs related on dynamic lighting generation)

Thankfully I could stole the most of objects and tetures from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/SceneKitReel/Introduction/Intro.html">sample projects by Apple</a>, <a href="http://tf3dm.com/">tf3dm.com</a>, and <a href="http://sharecg.com">sharecg.com</a>
